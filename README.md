# pandas_multinomial
Confidence intervals for multinomial proportions for pandas dataframes for fast analysis and plotting

This is a simple extension of the statsmodels function stats.proportion.multinomial_proportions_confint from Josef Perktold 
to handle pandas dataframes.
The aim of this code is to avoid time-consuming for loops over a dataframe containing multinomial experiments in each row.
